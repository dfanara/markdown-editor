# Live (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

Remix of [jbt/markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) to look more like GitHub's markdown styles.

Feel free to take the code and copy it and modify it and use it however you like. (If you really want a licence, see [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/))
